# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

# Take two numbers as input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number:"))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number:"))

# Perform operations
Addition = num1 + num2
print("Addition is:",Addition)
subtraction = num1 - num2
print("Subtraction is:",subtraction)
multiplication = num1 * num2
print("Multiplication is:",multiplication)
division = num1 / num2
print("Division is:",division)
